# `use_state` and `use_ref`

Most components you will write in Dioxus will need to store state somehow. For local state, we provide two very convenient hooks:

- `use_state`
- `use_ref`

Both of these hooks are extremely powerful and flexible, so we've dedicated this section to understanding them properly.

## Note on Hooks

If you're struggling with errors due to usage in hooks, make sure you're following the rules of hooks:


## `use_state`

The `use_state` hook is very similar to its React counterpart. 




## `use_ref`
