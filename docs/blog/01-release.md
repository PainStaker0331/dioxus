- Rust's smart pointers make use_state extremely easy and fun to work with.
- Multiple flavors (raw, html, rsx) of templating to pick-and-choose for the type of component.
- Extensible DSL through traits and impls plus support for WebComponents.
- Simple-to-implement trait for new reconcilers.
- Fast retained-mode server-side-renderer that works with buffered writers, files, and strings.
- Compile-time correct inline CSS as well as global styling.
- Integrated "signal" system allows for near-instant updates by skipping the diff algorithm entirely.
- Built-in cooperative scheduler (IE React's fiber mechanism).
- Built-in asynchronous scheduler for coroutines and tasks within components.
- Built-in suspense scheduler for Rust's futures.
- Extremely fast diffing algorithm for the most complex of apps.
- Runs natively on mobile and on desktop with no need for a 3rd party JS engine.
- Drastically fewer runtime errors and crashes with first-class error handling.
- Extremely powerful iterator and optional chaining integration for fast and robust apps.
