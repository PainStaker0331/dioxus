//! # Overview and Goals
//!
//! Dioxus makes it easy to quickly build complex user interfaces with Rust. Any Dioxus app can run in the web browser,
//! as a desktop app, as a mobile app, or anywhere else provided you build the right renderer.
//!
//! Dioxus is heavily inspired by React, supporting many of the same concepts:
//!
//! - Hooks for state
//! - VirtualDom & diffing
//! - Concurrency, fibers, and asynchronous rendering
//! - JSX-like templating syntax
//!
//! If you know React, then you know Dioxus.
//!
//! Dioxus is *substantially* more performant than many of the other Rust UI libraries (Yew/Percy) and is *significantly* more performant
//! than React - roughly competitve with InfernoJS.
//!
//! Remember: Dioxus is a library for declaring interactive user interfaces - it is not a dedicated renderer. Most 1st party renderers for Dioxus currently only support web technologies.
//!
//! ## Brief Overview
//!
//! All Dioxus apps are built by composing functions that take in a `Scope` which is generic over some `Properties` and return an `Element`.
//! A `Scope` holds relevant state data for the the currently-rendered component.
//!
//! To launch an app, we use the `launch` method for the specific renderer we want to use. In the launch function, was pass the app's `Component`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dioxus::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     dioxus::desktop::launch(app);
//! }
//!
//! fn app(cx: Scope<()>) -> Element {
//!     cx.render(rsx!("hello world!"))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! We can compose these function components to build a complex app. Each new component we design must take some Properties.
//! For components with no explicit properties, we can use the `()` type. In Dioxus, all properties are memoized by default!
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn App(cx: Scope<()>) -> Element {
//!     cx.render(rsx!(
//!         Header {
//!             title: "My App",
//!             color: "red",
//!         }
//!     ))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Our `Header` component takes in a `title` and a `color` property, which we delcare on an explicit `HeaderProps` struct.
//! ```
//! // The `Props` derive macro lets us add additional functionality to how props are interpreted.
//! #[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
//! struct HeaderProps {
//!     title: String,
//!     color: String,
//! }
//!
//! fn Header(cx: Scope<HeaderProps>) -> Element {
//!     cx.render(rsx!(
//!         div {
//!             background_color: "{cx.props.color}"
//!             h1 { "{cx.props.title}" }
//!         }
//!     ))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hooks
//!
//! While components are reusable forms of UI elements, hooks are reusable forms of logic. All hooks start with `use_`. We can use hooks to declare state.
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn app(cx: Scope<()>) -> Element {
//!     let name = use_state(&cx, || "world");
//!
//!     rsx!(cx, "hello {name}!")
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Hooks are sensitive to how they are used. To use hooks, you must abide by the ["rules of hooks" (borrowed from react)](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html):
//! - Hooks should not be called in callbacks
//! - Hooks should not be called in out of order
//! - Hooks should not be called in loops or conditionals
//!
//! In a sense, hooks let us add a field of state to our component without declaring
//! an explicit struct. However, this means we need to "load" the struct in the right
//! order. If that order is wrong, then the hook will pick the wrong state and panic.
//!
//! Most hooks you'll write are simply composition of other hooks:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn use_username(cx: &ScopeState, id: Uuid) -> bool {
//!     let users = use_context::<Users>(cx);
//!     users.get(&id).is_some().map(|user| user.logged_in).ok_or(false)
//! }
//! ```
//!  
//! To create entirely new foundational hooks, we can use the `use_hook` method on ScopeState.
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn use_mut_string(cx: &ScopeState) -> &mut String {
//!     cx.use_hook(|_| "Hello".to_string(), |hook| hook)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to extend Dioxus with some new functionality, you'll probably want to implement a new hook from scratch.
//!
//! ## Putting it all together
//!
//! Using components, templates, and hooks, we can build a simple app.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dioxus::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     dioxus::desktop::launch(App);
//! }
//!
//! fn App(cx: Scope<()>) -> Element {
//!     let mut count = use_state(&cx, || 0);
//!
//!     cx.render(rsx!(
//!         div { "Count: {count}" }
//!         button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, "Increment" }
//!         button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, "Decrement" }
//!     ))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! This overview doesn't cover everything. Make sure to check out the tutorial and reference guide on the official
//! website for more details.
//!
//! Beyond this overview, Dioxus supports:
//! - Server-side rendering
//! - Concurrent rendering (with async support)
//! - Web/Desktop/Mobile support
//! - Pre-rendering and rehydration
//! - Fragments, Portals, and Suspense
//! - Inline-styles
//! - Custom event handlers
//! - Custom elements
//! - Basic fine-grained reactivity (IE SolidJS/Svelte)
//! - and more!
//!
//! Good luck!
//!
//! ## Inspiration, Resources, Alternatives and Credits
//!
//! Dioxus is inspired by:
//! - React: for its hooks, concurrency, suspense
//! - Dodrio: for its research in bump allocation, double buffering, and diffing architecture
//!
//! Alternatives to Dioxus include:
//! - Yew: supports function components and web, but no SSR, borrowed data, or bump allocation. Rather slow at times.
//! - Percy: supports function components, web, ssr, but lacks in state management
//! - Sycamore: supports function components, web, ssr, but closer to SolidJS than React
//! - MoonZoom/Seed: opionated in the Elm model (message, update) - no hooks
//!
//! We've put a lot of work into making Dioxus ergonomic and *familiar*.
//! Our target audience is TypeSrcipt developers looking to switch to Rust for the web - so we need to be comparabale to React.
