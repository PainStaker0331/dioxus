/// A virtual node sÂ ystem that progresses user events and diffs UI trees.
///
///
/// ## Guide
///
/// Components are defined as simple functions that take [`Context`] and a [`Properties`] type and return an [`Element`].  
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// #[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
/// struct AppProps {
///     title: String
/// }
///
/// fn App(cx: Scope<AppProps>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!(
///         div {"hello, {cx.props.title}"}
///     ))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Components may be composed to make complex apps.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// fn App(cx: Scope<AppProps>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!(
///         NavBar { routes: ROUTES }
///         Title { "{cx.props.title}" }
///         Footer {}
///     ))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To start an app, create a [`VirtualDom`] and call [`VirtualDom::rebuild`] to get the list of edits required to
/// draw the UI.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(App);
/// let edits = vdom.rebuild();
/// ```
///
/// To inject UserEvents into the VirtualDom, call [`VirtualDom::get_scheduler_channel`] to get access to the scheduler.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let channel = vdom.get_scheduler_channel();
/// channel.send_unbounded(SchedulerMsg::UserEvent(UserEvent {
///     // ...
/// }))
/// ```
///
/// While waiting for UserEvents to occur, call [`VirtualDom::wait_for_work`] to poll any futures inside the VirtualDom.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// vdom.wait_for_work().await;
/// ```
///
/// Once work is ready, call [`VirtualDom::work_with_deadline`] to compute the differences between the previous and
/// current UI trees. This will return a [`Mutations`] object that contains Edits, Effects, and NodeRefs that need to be
/// handled by the renderer.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let mutations = vdom.work_with_deadline(|| false);
/// for edit in mutations {
///     apply(edit);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Building an event loop around Dioxus:
///
/// Putting everything together, you can build an event loop around Dioxus by using the methods outlined above.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// fn App(cx: Scope<()>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!{
///         div { "Hello World" }
///     })
/// }
///
/// async fn main() {
///     let mut dom = VirtualDom::new(App);
///
///     let mut inital_edits = dom.rebuild();
///     apply_edits(inital_edits);
///
///     loop {
///         dom.wait_for_work().await;
///         let frame_timeout = TimeoutFuture::new(Duration::from_millis(16));
///         let deadline = || (&mut frame_timeout).now_or_never();
///         let edits = dom.run_with_deadline(deadline).await;
///         apply_edits(edits);
