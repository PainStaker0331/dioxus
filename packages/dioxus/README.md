# Dioxus

This crate serves as the thin frontend over dioxus-core and dioxus-app. Here, we support docs, feature flags, and incorporate some extra tools and utilities into a consistent API.

Ideally, we can prevent cfg creep into the core crate by moving it all into this frontend crate.

For now, see dioxus-core for all docs and details
