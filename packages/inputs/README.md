# Cross-platform controlled inputs

Dioxus does not include controlled inputs in Dioxus-Core. This would require core integration with HTML that is inherently not cross platform. Instead, this crate exists to provide a bunch of cross-platform input types that abstract over renderer quirks.

Included is:

- Button
- Checkbox
- Color
- Date
- Datetime-local
- Email
- File
- Hidden
- Image
- Month
- Number
- Password
- Radio
- Range
- Reset
- Search
- Submit
- Tel
- Text
- Time
- Url
- Week
