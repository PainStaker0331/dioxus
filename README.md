# About

Dioxus is a portable, performant, and ergonomic framework for building cross-platform user experiences in Rust.

```rust
static Example: FC<()> = |ctx| {
    let (value, set_value) = use_state(&ctx, || "...?");

    ctx.view(html! {
        <div>
            <button onclick={move |_| set_value("world!")}> "?" </button>
            <button onclick={move |_| set_value("Dioxus ðŸŽ‰")}> "?" </button>
            <div>
                <h1> "Hello, {value}" </h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    })
};
```

Dioxus can be used to deliver webapps, desktop apps, static pages, liveview apps, Android apps, iOS Apps, and more. At its core, Dioxus is entirely renderer agnostic and has great documentation for creating new renderers for any platform.

Dioxus is supported by Dioxus Labs, a company providing end-to-end services for building, testing, deploying, and managing Dioxus apps on all supported platforms, designed especially for your next startup.

## Features
Dioxus' goal is to be the most advanced UI system for Rust, targeting isomorphism and hybrid approaches. Our goal is to eliminate context-switching for cross-platform development - both in UI patterns and programming language. Hooks and components should work *everywhere* without compromise.

Dioxus Core supports:
- [x] Hooks for component state
- [ ] Concurrent rendering
- [ ] Context subscriptions
- [ ] State management integrations

Separately, we maintain a collection of high quality, cross-platform hooks and services in the dioxus-hooks repo:
- [ ] `dioxus-router`: A hook-based router implementation for Dioxus web apps

We also maintain two state management options that integrate cleanly with Dioxus apps:
- [ ] `dioxus-reducer`: ReduxJs-style global state management
- [ ] `dioxus-dataflow`: RecoilJs-style global state management
