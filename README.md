Dioxus is a portable, performant, and ergonomic framework for building cross-platform user experiences in Rust.

```rust
fn App(cx: Context<()>) -> DomTree {
    let mut count = use_state(cx, || 0);

    cx.render(rsx! {
        h1 { "High-Five counter: {count}" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, "Up high!" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, "Down low!" }
    })
};
```

Dioxus can be used to deliver webapps, desktop apps, static pages, liveview apps, eventually mobile apps (WIP), and more. At its core, Dioxus is entirely renderer agnostic and has great documentation for creating new renderers for any platform.

If you know React, then you already know Dioxus.

### **Things you'll love ‚ù§Ô∏è:**

- Ergonomic design
- Minimal boilerplate
- Simple build, test, and deploy
- Compile-time correct templating
- Support for fine-grained reactivity
- Support for html! and rsx! templates
- SSR, WASM, desktop, and mobile support
- Support for asynchronous batched rendering
- Powerful and simple integrated state management
- Rust! (enums, static types, modules, efficiency)

### Unique features:
- Incredible inline documentation. Supports hover and guides for all HTML elements, listeners, and events.
- Templates are "constified" at compile time. Nodes that don't change will won't be diffed.
- Custom bump-allocator backing for all components. Nearly 0 allocations for steady-state components.
- Starting a new app takes zero templates or special tools - get a new app running in just seconds.
- Desktop apps running natively (no Electron!) in less than 10 lines of code.
- The most ergonomic and powerful state management of any Rust UI toolkit.
- Multithreaded asynchronous coroutine scheduler for powerful async code.
- And more! Read the full release post here.

## Why?

TypeScript is a great addition to JavaScript, but comes with a lot of tweaking flags, a slight performance hit, and an uneven ecosystem where some of the most important packages are not properly typed. TypeScript provides a lot of great benefits to JS projects, but comes with its own "tax" that can slow down dev teams. Rust can be seen as a step up from TypeScript, supporting:

- static types for _all_ libraries
- advanced pattern matching
- immutability by default
- clean, composable iterators
- a good module system
- integrated documentation
- inline built-in unit/integration testing
- best-in-class error handling
- simple and fast build system (compared to webpack!)
- powerful standard library (no need for lodash or underscore)
- include_str! for integrating html/css/svg templates directly
- various macros (`html!`, `rsx!`) for fast template iteration

And much more. Dioxus makes Rust apps just as fast to write as React apps, but affords more robustness, giving your frontend team greater confidence in making big changes in shorter time. Dioxus also works on the server, on the web, on mobile, on desktop - and it runs completely natively so performance is never an issue.

# Parity with React

Dioxus is heavily inspired by React, but we want your transition to feel like an upgrade. Dioxus is _most_ of the way there, but missing a few key features. This parity table does not necessarily include important ecosystem crates like code blocks, markdown, resizing hooks, etc.
