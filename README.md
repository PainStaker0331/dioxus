# About

dioxus-studio (inspired by wasm-pack and webpack) is a tool to help get dioxus projects off the ground. It handles all the build, development, bundling, and publishing to make web development just a simple two commands: `cargo init` and `dioxus-cli publish`.

Best thing: 
- No NPM. 
- No Webpack. 
- No `node_modules`. 
- No Babel
- No parcel
- No rollup
- No ESLint
