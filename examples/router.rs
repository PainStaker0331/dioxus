//! Dioxus Router
//! -------------
//!
//! This exmaple showcases the Dioxus Router hook. This hook makes it possible to using the browser's navigation API to
//! display different content based on the Page's URL. The hook provides a configuration object that calls various
//! specified callbacks whenever the page URL changes. Using this hook should feel like building a "URL directory", similar
//! to how Tide handles paths.
